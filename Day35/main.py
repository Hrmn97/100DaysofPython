# Python - else in Loop
# As you have learned before, the else clause is used along with the if statement.

# Python allows the else keyword to be used with the for and while loops too. 
# The else block appears after the body of the loop. The statements in the else block will be 
# executed after all iterations are completed. The program exits the loop only after the else block is executed.
